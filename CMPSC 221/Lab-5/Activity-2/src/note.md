- This is the wrong way of implementing it
- You need one more class called StudentCourse to link the many to many connection
  - In this StudentCourse class
  - put both of the student and courses into a list
    - List<student>  list1;
    - List<courses>  list2;
  - NO LIST within courses or student class
